The soil microbiome represents a largely untapped reservoir of  secondary metabolites that can potentially antagonize fungal pathogens. However, most soil  bacteria cannot be cultivated using conventional techniques and therefore most of these  compounds remain unexplored. The overall goal of this two-year project was to extract and  characterize novel secondary metabolites from "unculturable" soil microbiomes that antagonize  Fusarium and other fungal plant pathogens. Initially, the Cytryn lab at the Volcani Institute (ARO)  identified candidate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding for potentially novel antifungal  compounds (specifically non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides) in soil and plant root  microbiomes using cutting-edge metagenomic platforms. Next, the Brady lab at Rockefeller  University (RU) screened archived soil metagenomic cosmid libraries for these BGCs, and  heterologously expressed them in suitable hosts. Finally, the Frenkel and Cytryn labs at ARO  assessed the capacity of these heterologous expressed strains to antagonize Fusarium and other fungal plant pathogens. Initially tomato and lettuce were analyzed, and subsequently roots of  cucumbers grown in suppressive (biochar amended) soils were targeted. We found that the  composition of tomato and lettuce root BGCs are similar to each other, but significantly different  from adjacent bulk soil, indicating that root bacteria possess specific secondary metabolites that  are potentially associated with rhizosphere competence. BGC linked to known metabolites  included various antimicrobial, (e.g., streptazone E, sessilin), antifungal (heat-stable antifungal  factor- HSAF, II and ECO-02301), and insecticidal (melingmycin, orfamide A) compounds. However, over 90% of the identified BGCs were moderately to significantly different from those  encoding for characterized secondary metabolites, highlighting the profusion of potentially novel  secondary metabolites in both root and soil environments. Novel BGCs that were abundant in  roots and remotely resembled those of antifungal compounds were transferred to RU for  subsequent screening and five were identified in RU soil metagenomic cosmid libraries. Two of  these clusters (BARD-1711 BARD-B481) were heterologously-expressed in a Streptomyces  albus J1074 strain, and transferred to ARO. The strain harboring BARAD-B481 was found to  antagonize Fusarium significantly more than the host strain, indicating that this BGCs product has  antifungal activity. Future studies will need to work on chemically characterizing the BARAD-B481  BGC and progress with the above described pipeline for other interesting BGCs.  aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023)  ereport paper 0aPlants, Protection of xResearch. 0aAntifungal agents. 0aFungi in agriculture. 7areport paper 2DNAL1 aBrady, Sean F., eauthor. uRockefeller University.1 aFrenkel, O., eauthor. uAgricultural Research Organization.2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, esponsor1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL00002  uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8134142 zCrossRef DOI Landing Page40uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5177.pdf40uhttps://doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134142.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections  analcatalog  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  be c2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134142  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL04981nam a2200577 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240070002200249100007600271245015300347264010100500300004400601336002800645337002800673338003800701500004100739520279800780588004703578593001703625650002603642650004003668655002403708700007003732710009003802787001803892787002003910856007403930856004804004856011904052912001504171919000804186919000804194926001404202930003504216946001104251958004004262964000904302965001504311972001104326974001704337987001304354990002304367994001304390991640583120742620230930222953.0cr |||||||||||230928s2022    is d    o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916405831207426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134143 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134143.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1400203925  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL0 aSF791 b.U48 20221 aUeti, Massaro Wilson, d1964- eauthor uAgricultural Research Service.10aIdentification, characterization and testing of geographically conserved Babesia bovis vaccine antigen candidates / cUeti.

Selection of the target  antigens was based on: (1) profile of expression in parasite blood stages; (2) prediction for protein  location on the parasite surface and/or on the surface of infected red blood cells; and (3) target  conservation between US and Israeli strains of B. bovis. Following these criteria, the B. bovis targets BBOV_IV009170, BBOV_III007410, BBOV_II001790, and BBOV_III008720 were  selected. Full-length genomic sequences of these four targets were compared between Israeli and  US strains of B. bovis. Four Israeli parasite strains/isolates were selected for gene conservation  analysis: sample ID \ 3330 (from Refet Netofa); sample ID \ 2673 (Refet Netofa); Sample ID  Newe Yaar - Shahar; and the Israeli B. bovis cultured live vaccine 2S61411. The reference B.  bovis Texas stain was also used in the analysis. Sequencing analysis showed considerable levels  of conservation ranging from 72.2-91.1% and 84.6-94.1% of amino acid identity and similarity,  respectively, by comparing Israeli and US B. bovis strains. Recombinant version of the four target  antigens were produced in E. coli, purified by nickel columns, and used for antigenic and  immunogenic analyses. Antigenic analysis revealed that B. bovis-infected cattle develop high  antibody titers to BBOV_III008720. In contrast, no antibodies against BBOV_IV009170,  BBOV_III007410, and BBOV_II001790 were detected in sera from infected cattle. Vaccine trial of the four antigens in cattle is currently being carried out. However, preliminary data show that after three inoculations all vaccinated animals (n=5) seroconverted to all four B. bovis antigens.  At the time of the preparation of this report, vaccinated and control animals are being challenged with a virulent B. bovis strain from Israel to evaluate protection. Results from the vaccination/trial  experiment will set the future directions of this work. Considering the overall results from this project, two manuscripts are currently in preparation. A manuscript currently in preparation will  describe the bioinformatics analysis and antigenic evaluation of the four transmembrane B. bovis proteins as potential targets for a subunit vaccine. A second manuscript will report the results from  the vaccination/challenge trial. We believe that we have successfully accomplished our objective in this project. By developing this work, we have identified, expressed, and tested conserved  antigens for a potential subunit vaccine against B. bovis, and have advanced the state-of-the-art concerning the development of an efficient and sustainable control strategy to bovine babesiosis.  aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023)  ereport paper 0aBabesiosis in cattle. 0aBabesiosis xImmunological aspects. 7areport paper 2DNAL1 aMazuz, Monica Leszkowicz, eauthor uKimron Veterinary Institute.2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, esponsor1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL00002  zCrossRef DOI Landing Page uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/813414340uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5157.pdf40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134143.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections  analcatalog  aaxu  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  be c2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134143  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL02330cam a2200589 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240070002500249100005700274245012600331264010300457300006700560336002800627337002800655338003800683593001700721500003500738500002800773588004700801655002400848650002600872650003200898787001800930787002000948700008400968700006601052700006301118710009001181856004801271856007401319856011901393912001501512919000801527926001401535930003501549946001301584958004201597964000901639965001501648972001101663974001701674987001301691990002301704994001301727991640603050742620230930225157.0cr |||||||||||230927s2022    is      o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916406030507426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134152 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134152.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1399975657  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL0 aGB1197.77 bF87 20221 aFurman, Alex eauthor uTechnion R&D Foundation Ltd.10aIncreasing water availability through agricultural groundwater recharge / cA.

Because of the quality  characteristics of treated wastewater, the small size and geometry of drip emitters, and flow  characteristics though the emitters, systems can become clogged for physical and biological  reasons. Emitters clogging reduces flow and increases the variability of flows between emitters  that can lead to crops water stress and thus reduce crop yield. Clogged systems require more  energy or more labor- and chemical-intensive maintenance and cleaning, such as with chlorine.  Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and specifically UV-C (200-300 nm) light emitting diodes (LEDs) have  great promise for disinfection and biofouling prevention in irrigation water systems. LEDs are  particularly well-suited for decentralized use in drip irrigation systems due to their small size,  robust construction, low power requirements, long life, and intermittent operation capability. The main goal of this research was to study and develop UV-LED irradiation technology for  reducing biofouling of drip irrigation fed by treated effluent, and to explore whether locating the  UV-LEDs along the irrigation line as an integral part of the system could be advantageous.0 aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023)  ereport paper 0aWater xPurification xIrradiation. 0aIrrigation efficiency. 0aMicroirrigation. 0aWater reuse. 7areport paper 2DNAL1 aLinden, Karl G., eauthor uThe University of Colorado.2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, esponsor1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL0000240uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5130.pdf  uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8134144 zCrossRef DOI Landing Page40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134144.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections  analcatalog  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  a2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134144  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL03459cam a2200637 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240070002800249100006500277245015500342264010100497300003300598336002800631337002800659338003800687593001700725500003300742500002900775520103300804588004701837655002401884650004401908650004101952650003601993650002202029787001802051787002002069700005402089700006502143700006102208710007902269856004802348856007402396856011902470912001502589919000802604919000802612926001402620930003502634946001102669958004002680964000902720965001502729972001102744974001702755987001302772990002302785994001302808991640583180742620230930222136.0cr |||||||||||230928s2022    is      o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916405831807426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134145 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134145.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1400074808  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL0 aTP248.65.F66 bP68 20221 aPoverenov, E., eauthor uAgricultural Research Organization10aGreen nature inspired nano-sanitizers for enhancing safety of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables / cPoverenov, E., Demokritou, P., Luo, Y., Rodov, V. 1a[Israel?] : bUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, c2022  a1 online resource (14 pages)  atext btxt 2rdacontent  acomputer bc 2rdamedia  aonline resource bcr 2rdacarrier  ereport paper  aBARD Final Report IS-5146-18  aProject award year: 20183 aIn this proposal, we suggest novel ways to address food safety problems  in the expanding sector of fresh, ready-to-eat, fresh-cut, minimally processed fruits  and vegetables. These products are becoming increasingly popular with consumers  because they provide an easy way to increase consumption of phytonutrient-rich fresh  foods, as recommended by health experts. However, ready-to-eat fresh fruits and  vegetables may be associated with two serious health hazards. The first hazard is microbiological; human pathogens, potentially present on raw fruits and vegetables,  may survive the mild interventions of minimal processing and could be further spread  by cross-contamination. The second hazard is chemical; typical decontamination  techniques use chlorine derivatives and strong oxidizers, which can taint food  products with potentially harmful and carcinogenic byproducts. The overall goal of this work is to provide consumers with  healthy and safe ready-to-eat produce that is free of microbial and chemical hazards0 aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023) 7areport paper 2DNAL 0aFood xBiotechnology xSafety measures. 0aVegetables xPostharvest technology. 0aFruit xPostharvest technology. 0aGreen technology.1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL000021 aDemokritou, Philip, eauthor uHarvard University1 aLuo, Yaguang, eauthor uUSDA, Agricultural Research Service1 aRodov, V., eauthor uAgricultural Research Organization2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund40uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5146.pdf  uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8134145 zCrossRef DOI Landing Page40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134145.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections  analcatalog  aaxu  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  be c2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134145  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL02255nam a2200589 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240070002400249100007200273245016000345264010100505300003200606336002800638337002800666338003800694500003300732500002900765588004700794593001700841650003900858650002700897650003900924650002500963655002400988700006301012710009001075787001801165787002001183856007401203856004801277856011601325912001501441919000801456926001401464930003501478946001101513958004001524964000901564965001501573972001101588974001701599987001301616990002301629994001301652991640592950742620230930224533.0cr |||||||||||230928s2022    is      o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916405929507426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134146 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134146.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1400205844  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL0 aSB933.3 b.P37 20221 aPapathanos, Philippos eauthor eThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem10aDeveloping synthetic sex ratio distorters for the genetic control of the Mediterranean fruit fly and the New World screwworm / cPapathanos, P., Scott M.J. 1a[Israel?] : bUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, c2022  a1 online resource (8 pages)  atext btxt 2rdacontent  acomputer bc 2rdamedia  aonline resource bcr 2rdacarrier  aBARD Final Report IS-5180-19  aProject award year: 2019  aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023)  ereport paper 0aInsect pests xBiological control. 0aPlants, Protection of. 0aMediterranean fruit-fly xControl. 0aScrewworm xControl. 7areport paper 2DNAL1 aScott, Max J., eauthor uNorth Carolina State University.2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, esponsor1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL00002  uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8134146 zCrossRef DOI Landing Page40uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5180.pdf40ahttps://doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134146.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections  analcatalog  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  be c2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134146  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL02738cam a2200637 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240070002400249100006300273245022000336264010100556300005100657336002800708337002800736338003800764593001700802500003300819500005900852588004700911655002400958650001800982650002001000650002301020787001801043787002001061700007401081700006901155700007601224700006401300700009101364700008701455710009001542856004801632856007401680856011901754912001501873919000801888926001401896930003501910946001101945958004201956964001001998965001502008972001102023974001702034987001302051990002302064994001302087991640593120742620230930224609.0cr |||||||||||230927s2022    is      o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916405931207426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134147 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134147.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1399970663  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL0 aS627.R45 bM67 20221 aMorin, Efrat eauthor uThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem10aRisk of soil erosion by water estimated with remotely-sensed rainfall data, process based models and weather generators / cE.

We are using tomato as a target, but also as a model for many other crops. Our focus is on two  different components of yield associated traits - shoot architecture and organization of the  inflorescence.  Our focus was on two types of regulators; 1) genes involved in florigen - antiflogen balance and  the way they impact the shoot, and 2) genes involved in inflorescence branching and it this way,  the way they impact the number of flowers produced by the plant. For the first class, we described  our thoughts on that matter in a joint review (Eshed and Lippman, 2019) where we argued that  annualization of short-lived vine plants such as tomato and soybean was their major adaptation for  intensive modern farming. This annualization was achieved by introduction of mutations in the  anti florigen gene SELFPRUNING, mutations that were also used to domesticate/adapt cotton,  roses, strawberries and more (Eshed and Lippman, 2019). Indeed, introduction of this mutation  and additional one in another antifloraigen gene SP5G into a vine type tomatoes resulted in  compact, early yielding plants suitable for urban agriculture (Kwon et al., 2020 - please note that  Yossi Capua, a former graduate student from the Eshed group is a coauthor of this study). The other side of this project, customized generation of large branched inflorescences, relied on  ongoing collaboration between the two labs on genes like S and genes of the SEP clade, J2 and  EJ2. We first showed that highly branched j2 ej2 inflorescences can be quantitatively modified by  introduction of either null or naturally weak alleles of the TM3/STM3 gene cluster (Alonge et al.,  2020). We next showed that variation in inflorescence branching can be obtained by customized  interreference in selected promoter motifs of S, a gene that is otherwise essential at the seed stage  (Hendelamn et al., 2021). Overall, our joint project provided some prime examples for targeted use of genome editing for  the formation of valuable alleles that can either improve modern crops or, significantly, open the  door for rapid "domestication" of orphan crops 7areport paper 2DNAL 0aPlant genetic engineering. 0aTomatoes. 0aPlant genomes.1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL000021 aLippman, Z.

Background: Wheat is an essential crop for global food security and is well adapted to a wide  variety of soils. However, the gene networks regulating different wheat root architectures remain  poorly understood. Root depth and biomass distribution in the soil profile are critical traits for  adaptation to water stress, and a good source for these traits is the introgression of the short arm  of rye chromosome one (1RS) into common wheat. A recombinant 1RS chromosome with a  small wheat 1BS introgressions and a duplicated 1RS segment (1RW) showed reduced drought  tolerance and was used for the identification of the causal genes.  aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023)  ereport paper 0aPlant genetics. 0aWheat xEffect of stress on. 7areport paper 2DNAL1 aFahima, T. q(Tzion), d1959- eauthor uUniversity of Haifa.2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, esponsor1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL00002  uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8134149 zCrossRef DOI Landing Page40uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5191.pdf40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134149.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections  analcatalog  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  be c2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134149  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL02255nam a2200577 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240070002600249100005000275245009900325264010100424300005900525336002800584337002800612338003800640500004100678500002900719588004700748593001700795650006200812650006900874655002400943700006800967700004901035710009001084787001801174787002001192856007401212856011901286856004801405912001501453919000801468926001401476930003501490946001101525958004001536964000901576965001501585972001101600974001701611987001301628990002301641994001301664991640602950742620230930225021.0cr |||||||||||230928s2022    is da   o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916406029507426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134150 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134150.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1400202933  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL0 aHD9275.I75 bF73 20221 aFrank, Eyal eauthor uUniversity of Chicago.10aClimate change and the dairy sector in Israel and the US / cFrank, E., Fishman, R., Kimhi, A. 1a[Israel?] : bUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, c2022  a1 online resource (50 pages) : billustrations, charts  atext btxt 2rdacontent  acomputer bc 2rdamedia  aonline resource bcr 2rdacarrier  aBARD Second Annual Report IS-5150-19  aProject award year: 2019  aOnline resource (viewed 28 September 2023)  ereport paper 0aDairy products industry xEnvironmental aspects zIsrael. 0aDairy products industry xEnvironmental aspects zUnited States. 7areport paper 2DNAL1 aKimhi, Ayal, d1959- eauthor uHebrew University of Jerusalem.1 aFishman, R., eauthor uTel Aviv University.2 aUnited States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, esponsor1 oproduct_naldc1 onaldc_COLL00002  uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8134150 zCrossRef DOI Landing Page40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32747/2022.8134150.bard 3Available in the National Agricultural Library Digital Collections40uhttps://www.bard-isus.com/FinalRep/5150.pdf  analcatalog  aaxu  aPDF model  a20230928 b00000000 c00000000  aNon-US  be c2023/09/28 do ecsussman hcfr  aBARD  a2023-09-30  aIssued  aagid:8134150  acsussman  cNAL DOI collection  aC0 bAGL02306cam a2200577 i 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049016003300090024002400123024003700147035002400184040003200208049000900240100006100249245019300310264010100503300005200604336002800656337002800684338003800712593001700750588004700767500003400814500002900848655002400877650003900901650001200940787001800952787002000970700005700990700006601047700005801113710009001171856004801261856007401309856011901383912001501502919000801517926001401525930003501539946001101574958004201585964000901627965001501636972001101651974001701662987001301679990002301692994001301715991640603020742620230930225113.0cr |||||||||||230927s2022    is      o     000 0 eng d7 aCAT109916406030207426 2DNAL7 a10113/8134151 2hdl7 a10.32747/2022.8134151.bard 2doi  a(OCoLC)on1399981631  aAGL beng erda cAGL dAGL  aAGLL1 aGamrasni, Dan eauthor uMigal Galilee Technology Center10aNew insights into apple calcium application : bunderstanding its contradicting effects on postharvest disorders for improved fruit quality / cD.
